- The River Styx and the Tartarus Gates – Greek Underworld
- The River Styx, a mystical and ominous boundary of the Greek underworld, flows into the depths of Tartarus. Beyond its dark waters lies a realm of despair, where Titans and Giants remain imprisoned, each locked behind enchanted gates. At its heart stands the Crimson Tent, a symbol of ultimate confrontation, while Forsaken Palaces remind us of the infernal power lurking in the shadows.

- Journey carefully, for Tartarus is guarded by fiends and flames, and only the most determined heroes will uncover its treasures and secrets.
