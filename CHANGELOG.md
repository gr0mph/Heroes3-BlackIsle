# Heroes3: Black Isle - Horn of the Abyss

Changelog

## v1.2.4

[+] Careful recruitment allows the AI ​​to defend its fortress. As on the Maelstrom map, a periodic event allows the AI ​​to recruit new creatures. This recruitment relies on the same artifacts as those making up the Statue of the Legion (5/4/3/2/1), ideally daily, but adapted to an accessible difficulty.
[+] The AI ​​should no longer have a money problem, a periodic event for each city depending on the city sends enough resources to allow the AI ​​to recruit everything.

[-] Remove firewall scroll to dwelling level 7.
[-] Replace artifact object in quest by scroll.
[-] Antagonistic heroes' primary skills progress via a ramp instead of a sudden upgrade.
