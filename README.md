# Heroes3-BlackIsle
An epic Heroes3 scenario with the Factory, Cove or Dungeon faction.

## Scenario Description
In the sleeping tavern, a boil is underway. A map found gives the exact location of a fortress built on an island, abandoned for ages. Four scouts left but no return since. Hurry, the fortress houses immeasurable treasures, and perhaps... even greater danger.

## Victory Condition
Defeat all enemies
